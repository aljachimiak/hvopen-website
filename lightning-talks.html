      At an HV Open meeting, every single person there knows at
      least <b>10</b> interesting things about open technology that at
      least <b>half</b> the room does not know. This group exists to
      share this interesting information with each other. One way we
      do this is with a series of short lightning talks before the
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good lightning talk is:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Short</b> - 5 minutes (we let people go up to 10, but
          no longer than that)
        <li><b>Interesting</b> - it shares something new with the
          group, and gives people a hook at to why they might be
          impacted by it or use it.
        <li><b>Path to learn more</b> - almost anything you'd talk
          about with a lightning talk would take much more than 5
          minutes to understand. That's ok. Consider it the "movie
          trailer" for the topic. Make sure the audience knows where
          to satisfy their curiosity and learn more.
      </ul>
