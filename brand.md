# Brand Guidelines #

This is a set of guidelines to help with consistency when discussing
HV Open, and in creating colateral like stickers, posters, or other
promotional materials.

## Naming ##

The following are the official names for HV Open:

* hvopen
* HV Open
* Hudson Valley Open Technology Meetup

## Fonts ##

The font used for the HV Open logo
is
[Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
which is was released by Adobe under the open font license. The
rendered HV Open logo was produced on a Mac, which does font rendering
slightly differently. If working on Linux don't expect a pixel for
pixel render of the font the same way.

## Colors ##

The following colors are used througout the website, and this pallete
should be used in any branding material for consistency.

### HV Open Social Logo ###

The main HV Open logo is roughly a 3x1 aspect ratio. Many social media
sites require something that's closer to 1x1. There is a social logo
designed for that (and the basis for the favicon).
