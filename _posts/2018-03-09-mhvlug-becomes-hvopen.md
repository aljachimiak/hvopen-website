15 years ago MHVLUG was formed around the nascent Linux operating
system. Linux was just transitioning from the hobbyist and ISP realms
into every day work in non technology businesses. What Linux needed
was human networks where people could get together and help each other
with what they were learning. MHVLUG was created to be that kind of
place. We started a monthly lecture series to share our expertise. We
held regular weekend install fests to help people install and
configure Linux on their computers.

A lot has changed in 15 years. Linux is now everywhere. As a group, we
branched out from just Linux pretty quickly. Over the past few years
our agenda has rarely included Linux itself. Open data efforts, like
Open Street maps. Preservation of culture efforts, like the Internet
Archive. Even addressing other challenges we have in the field, like
Overcoming Imposter Syndrome. Our content evolved, but the name
remained the same.

A name is a first impression. And it became more and more clear that
Linux User Group comes with a lot of preconceptions in the minds of
folks not familiar with our group. Those preconceptions keep folks
away. Folks we'd love to have in the room, on the stage, and part of
our leadership team. 15 years is a nice round number, and a sensible
place to make the break from the old to the new.

### What does this mean for the monthly meetings? ###

Very little. Meetings will still be happening every 1st Wednesday and
the content will largely be similar. This gives us a little more
freedom on topic choices, anchored around the concept of open
technologies.

### What does this mean for the website? ###

Over the next 6 months we'll be converting over to the new branding
across our website and all the social networks we participate in. As
this is a nights and weekend effort, it will take a while. Expect to
see both mhvlug and hvopen references for a while.

### Lots of thanks to go around ###

Thanks to Al Jachimiak for triggering the rebrand idea
initially. Thanks to Milo Axelrod for working with us to provide the
new branding. Thanks to the leadership team for helping shephard this
process along.
