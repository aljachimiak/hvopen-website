    Every July we gather together in a special MHVLUG event we call
    the Mad Science Fair. People are encouraged to bring their
    hardware and software hacking projects in a show and tell
    forum. We'll have gtables set up with power available. We kick off
    the evening with a short inspirational video, and then proceed to
    interactive discussions with people showing what they've
    got. Everyone is welcomed to come and enjoy, even if you don't
    have something to exhibit.
