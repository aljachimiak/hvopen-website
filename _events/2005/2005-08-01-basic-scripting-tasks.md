Jim Doherty will discuss methods used to have Linux automatically complete tasks so you don't have to. I will cover both bash &amp; Perl scripting. For Perl I will cover modules and some of what you can find on CPAN (The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network which contains a vast array of prepackaged Perl modules). With luck I can cover the scripting functions that RPM provides for pre and post installation phases for package installation, and for the really lazy person Make (the all purpose UNIX build tool) can be very useful as well.
