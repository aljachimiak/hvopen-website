Do you run a Linux computer that is connected to the Internet in any way? Do you want to know: Â 
- how to minimize the risk of it getting hacked?
- if you already got hacked?
- how to figure out how you got hacked?
- what not to do in putting your computer back on line?

Then come to tonight's MHVLUG meeting where Mike Kershaw will be talking about issues related to Linux Security, and how to clean up if it goes horribly wrong.
