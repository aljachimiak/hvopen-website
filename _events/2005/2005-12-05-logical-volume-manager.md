> "Logical Volume Management (LVM) is an abstraction layer over the hard drives, which allows the Linux kernel to access the filesystems normally, yet each filesystem may be comprised of multiple hard drives. The main benefit you may see with LVM is when you run out of space in a filesystem (/home, for example), you can either resize the filesystems on the fly, or add another hard drive and spread /home across the two drives."
-Linux Journal 2002


Come join us on Monday, December 5th, as Mike Grundy explains the joys and benefits of using LVM in Linux instead of plain old partitions like most of us are used to.
