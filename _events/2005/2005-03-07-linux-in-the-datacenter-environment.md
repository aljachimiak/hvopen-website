This talk will focus on the extra needs of running a [colocated](http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;q=define:colocation) linux server. Everyone may find this lecture interesting: Its designed as a crash course in datacenter operations for those not looking to colocate, a hint of experience for those who are considering colocation, and a source of ideas for those who work in the datacenter environment. Topics covered: finding a datacenter &amp; how they operate, hardware (sources for critical parts...think MTBF), software (what should you run), and settings (keeping up to date, backups on the cheep, hardware monitoring).
