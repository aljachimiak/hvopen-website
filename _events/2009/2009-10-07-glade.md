The use of Glade allows developers to design their user interfaces and export the layouts as language-independent XML to be imported in code later. This makes complex layouts and adjustment details quick and easy, allowing programmers to focus their code on application logic.

This talk will briefly discuss GNOME, GTK+, libglade to understand how the pieces fit, then focus on the advantages and use of Glades. Examples will be shown and provided.
