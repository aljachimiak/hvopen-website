Every wonder about all this hype around Ruby on Rails?  Why everyone is talking about it?   What is that Rails thing all about?

Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.  Spoken plainly, this means an application framework that makes it very quick to develop a new web application, very easy to extend an existing application, and makes long term maintenance of  these applications extremely clear and simple.

Sean Dague will be presenting getting started with Ruby on Rails. This will include developing a simple web application from scratch to show some of the basic principles of working with Ruby on Rails.

The presentation will also demonstrate how to use Ruby on Rails to work with legacy systems, and show a number of applications and source code built on top of Rails written by Sean.
