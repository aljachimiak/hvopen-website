Kubernetes seems to be all the rage in todayâ€™s cloud focused,
microservice architecture hyped world - but what is this mysterious
beast and how does one use it in practice?

In the first part of this talk, Dan will take you through the core
architectural concepts behind Kubernetes, give a fast crash course on
docker images and containers, and speak about Kubernetes as a
practical, elegant, reliable and manageable solution for applications
of any size or scale.

The second part will be focused on getting an app up and running on
Kuberneres using the Google Container Engine. Dan will take the
audience through the basic bootstrapping of a Kubernetes cluster,
fundamental application architecture including container design, pod
and service description and creation, deployment, storage management,
and exposing a service on the public internet.

In addition to the above topics and demonstration, Dan will be
available to answer questions about his knowledge and experience in
deploying clusters for Moonfarmer clients.

Dan Stone is the Senior Creative Technologist at Moonfarmer, a design
and development studio in Kingston, NY where he works as an
application architect and sometime DevOps ringmaster.
