Most modern devices, whether open or closed source, depend upon the Internet for its functionality. This involves network addressing, both your own and your destination.

The IP methodology is "Open" in this respect, but many of us may not solve these challenges using IPv6...yet. We will discuss what's wrong with our old, familiar IP addressing scheme and how the new IPv6 version addresses those problems. This talk will cover the changes needed to shift your system away from the old, outdated and highly stretched addressing scheme and march boldly into the New World of v6.
