Electronic music permeates through our daily lives. We are bombarded everyday with commercials that blast dub step and electro house to sell their wares. But the tools and sounds we know today, took place long before the prevalence of these genres. What has changed though, is how these digital tools have become the staples to genres that once frowned on their use. In fact, today, you would be hard pressed to find music not electronically produced, no matter the genre.

Mike and Matthias will go over some of the history on how audio production has progressed. The focus will be placed on open source and free tools demonstrating some of the work flows of musical production as well as how to create many of the sounds we hear today.
