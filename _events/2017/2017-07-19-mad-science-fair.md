Every July we gather together in a special MHVLUG event we call the Mad Science Fair. People are encouraged to bring their hardware and software hacking projects in a show and tell forum. We'll have tables set up with power available. We kick off the evening with a short inspirational video, and then proceed to interactive discussions with people showing what they've got. Everyone is welcomed to come and enjoy, even if you don't have something to exhibit.

Exibitors are asked to fill out this quick survey so we can have enough spaces set up - [https://goo.gl/forms/5SwGAU1fgBioceuD2](https://goo.gl/forms/5SwGAU1fgBioceuD2) - Please RSVP by July 14th with your project details and needs.

Some of this year's projects that you get to see:
- Converting Vacuum Tubes into cool ambiant lights
- Open source projects with [Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/feather)
- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) (open source home automation hub)

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

(Note: due to conflicts with Holidays and HV Tech Dev O'Clock, this is happening on the 3rd Wed in July).
