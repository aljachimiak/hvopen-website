title: Building an IoT Weather Station
type: meeting
---


Seven years ago I started down the process of trying to get my simple Oregon Scientific weather station talking to the internet. This talk is going to dive deep down the rabbit hole of all the bits of bubble gum and duct tape you need to pull together to do that. We'll discuss how cheap consumer weather sensors communicate, how you can intercept that, MQTT (an IoT message bus), the weather underground API, and pulling data into projects like Home Assistant. And a show and tell of the hardware you would need to do it yourself.

Sean Dague is the president and founder of MHVLUG, and a Developer Advocate at IBM. He's a committer to OpenStack, Home Assistant, and numerous other open source projects. He's a frequent speak at open source conferences, sharing the things he's learned about cloud, home automation, and open source development in general.
