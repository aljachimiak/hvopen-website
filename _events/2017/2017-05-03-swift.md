Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.

If you're interested in coding along during the meetup, check out this [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/122189/introduction-to-open-source-swift-on-linux) to get set up.

And here is the official Swift [download page](https://swift.org/download/#releases) that includes binaries for some Ubuntu distributions.
