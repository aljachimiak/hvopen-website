<img align="right" width="225" hspace="5" height="250" alt="" src="/sites/default/files/LLVM-Logo-Derivative-4.png" />Crack is a C-like programming language that is being developed by the presenter.  It aims to provide the ease of development of a scripting language with the performance of a compiled language. The "crack" program is a "script executor" that compiles source to machine code on the fly (eventually caching the code to intermediate formats as appropriate).

LLVM is a compiler toolkit that Crack uses for code generation.  It allows you to generate code for a Single Static Assignment based virtual machine.  LLVM virtual code can then be optimized, jitted or written to various other output formats.

This talk will cover the details of the Crack language and the use of LLVM, with some excursions into the world of compiler design and the differences between compiled and interpreted languages.
