<img align="right" width="316" hspace="5" height="220" alt="" src="/sites/default/files/arduino316.jpg" />[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software.

While you need not be a Real Engineer to build a project around an Arduino, being a Real Programmer can sometime pose serious problems. Ed will explain why that's so, starting with Arduino's historical background and the crucial differences between a microcontroller and a PC.

The Arduino universe includes a wide variety of add-on boards that provide functions ranging from pushbuttons to LCD panels to Ethernet interfaces. You may not need much solder to produce a useful (or at least amusing) project of your very own.

Ed will bring along some Show-n-Tell projects that appeared in his   Circuit Cellar column, so you can see Arduino boards in their native   habitat.
