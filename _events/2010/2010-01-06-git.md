<img align="right" hspace="5" src="http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_logo.png" alt="" />[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is one of the leading distributed source code control systems. Originally developed to specifically help with workflows in the Linux kernel, git has seen rapid acceptance on a number of other projects due to it's flexibility and speed. Git takes a bit of education to use effectively, which this talk will hopefully provide.

The talk will cover some of the history of source code management to provide some context, then jump right into git workflows. The goal of the meeting is to have everyone feel comfortable with basic git commands by the end of the meeting, and hopefully introduce you to some of the more interesting and major features in git.

This meeting will be streamed live on ustream on the [MHVLUG channel](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/mhvlug) for those members of our community that can't attend the meetings directly.
