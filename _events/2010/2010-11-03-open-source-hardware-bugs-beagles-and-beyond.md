<img align="right" alt="" height="193" hspace="5" src="/sites/default/files/BUG20_Custom2.jpg" width="300" />The Open Source Hardware movement is picking up speed, trying to duplicate the benefits realized with Open Source Software. But, atoms are harder than bits. Bringing an idea from paper to the physical world introduces some challenges that aren't as easy to solve in the physical world. The development of hardware and the surrounding community will be explored using [Bug Labs](http://www.buglabs.net/)' work on bringing their BugBase 2.0 to market and its relationship to the [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org/) and its larger development community.
