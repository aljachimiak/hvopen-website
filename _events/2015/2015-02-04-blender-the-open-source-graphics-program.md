Even the cheapest programs can cost around 1700$. Blender offers an alternative. Blender is completely free, open source, and constantly being updated. Blender, often overlooked because of its price or lack there of, has many capabilities not the least of which is the two internal rendering engines, an internal game engine, and a Python interpreter for scripting.<br />This presentation will demonstrate the vast capabilities of Blender in both rendering and game engine based simulations. First with a material study using blender cycles. Then with a small fluid simulation.

Presented by Evan Palmiotti.
