Interested in Cloud? Heard of this OpenStack thing and want to get your hands dirty? Concerned that it's too confusing for mere mortals? It's not, and in just a couple of hours you too can have a cloud in your basement.

Sean Dague, president and founder of MHVLUG, and long standing contributor to OpenStack, will take you through the journey of building such a minimal OpenStack for home or small business use. He'll go through the minimum configuration needed to get started, explaining how the components work together. How to start small and grow as your needs expand over time. And touch on some of the rest of the OpenStack ecosystem that you might want to pull in later.
