Come out for a night of show and tell on open hardware projects. Bring your Arduino, Beagle, Raspberry Pi, or other open hardware based project and show it off. Share experiences with others, and learn about all the amazing things you can do with these inexpensive open source platforms.

We'll have tables set up and do this science fair style, where people will roam around and check out projects by others. All levels of experience are welcome to present and participate.

Starting with this short film on [Why We Make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_otrgJ8Lmx4).
