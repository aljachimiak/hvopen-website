Transforming a concept into an a tangible thing is not easy. Depending on the scope of the project it can be a major undertaking requiring solutions and interactions with people that you may not anticipate. However, many projects never get off the ground and the magnitude of a project often is not the reason; even the smallest projects that require minimal effort are frequently left unfinished. Seeing a concept through requires discipline, planning, knowledge, and often a bit of luck. In this meeting, panel members will share their experiences in coordinating and executing projects and what they have learned along the way.
