In the modern computer era we have lots of clocks, and any programmer that's had to deal with dates, times, and timezones will realize how truly mind boggling this can get.

This talk will be about time in software, and all the crazy things you never thought you'd have to deal with. We'll talk about timezones, summer time, various leap quantities, issues related to time skew, interchanging time / data formats between software, and introduce you to all the assumptions you make about time, which computers love to violate.
