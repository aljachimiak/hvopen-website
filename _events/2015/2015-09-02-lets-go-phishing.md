So you have your firewalls, intrusion detection systems and whatever the new whizbang security technology is in place?  So you're ready, right!  Well have you secured your people?  Most security breaches these day involve individuals getting tricked at some point in the process.  Paul will be talking about some of the social engineering methods used by both white and black hat hackers, why they work, and some ways of defending against them.
