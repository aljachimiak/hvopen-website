Contributing to Rails for the first time can be terrifying. In this talk I’ll make contributing to Rails more approachable by going over the contributing guidelines and technical details you need to know. We’ll walk through traversing the source code with tools such as CTags, source_location and TracePoint. Additionally, we’ll create reproduction scripts for reporting issues and learn advanced git commands like bisect, and reflog, and learn how to alter your git history with interactive rebase. At the end of this session you’ll have the confidence to fix bugs and add features to Ruby on Rails.

Eileen M. Uchitelle is a programmer on Basecamp’s Performance, Security, and Infrastructure team. Eileen is an ardent contributor to open source, focusing most of her energy on improving Rails. When taking a break from the excitement of refactoring source code, Eileen enjoys craft beer and hiking in the Hudson Valley with her husband and their beautiful doge, @AryaDog.
