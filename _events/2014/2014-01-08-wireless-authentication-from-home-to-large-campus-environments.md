title: 'Wireless Authentication: From Home To Large Campus Environments'
type: meeting
---


An introduction to how wireless devices are authenticated by wireless networks.  Presentation will begin with the simplest case of how an end user can secure a single wireless router at home then launch into how secure authentication works in large scale campus wireless deployments.  Audience members will end up going down the rabbit hole and be exposed to the "how things work" of wireless authentication and RADIUS at a level no sane person would chose to experience.
