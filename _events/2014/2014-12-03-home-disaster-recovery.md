**Note: this meeting is in the Rocky 300 room, one floor up from our normal meeting location.**

Our December meeting often a "shootout" where we assemble a panel of volunteers to talk about their solutions, use cases, and of course to share stories. This year we will have a panel shootout centered around home backup and recovery solutions. Hopefully you have implemented some kind of backup system for your personal data, if so, sign up. We would like to hear about. If you have no backup solution, come show up, learn and get ideas from our other members.
