Samba is the standard Microsoft Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. Many improvements have been made over the years to the Samba project and this talk will focus on some of the more recent additions such as a Linux server acting as a Windows domain controller using Active Directory and dictating Group Policy to Windows desktops.

Matthias Johnson is currently the Director of Technolgy at Our Lady of Lourdes High School in Poughkeepsie, NY.
