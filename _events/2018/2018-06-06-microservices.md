title: Learning Microservices in the open with Game On! Text Adventure
type: meeting
---

Fresh off our talk in May on Kubernetes, lets dive into what it takes
to write a good application for the environment.

Writing a microservice is easy right? There are plenty of tutorials
out there showing how you can create a microservice application using
just a few clicks and some annotations. But what happens when you
create your own microservice and are hit with the reality of testing,
deploying and managing your new application?

[Game On!](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/gameontext/gameon-gitbook/details) is
an interactive text-based adventure game written as a collection of
microservices designed to help people answer these questions. In this
session we will discuss how we used service composition and domain
driven design, API versioning, security, and a combination of
lightweight protocols to build the game. We will also talk about the
evolving relationship between [twelve factor](https://12factor.net/)
applications and supporting infrastructure.

### Lightning Talks ###
