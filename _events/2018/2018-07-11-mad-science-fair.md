Every July we gather together in a special HV Open event we call the
Mad Science Fair. People are encouraged to bring their hardware and
software hacking projects in a show and tell forum. We'll have tables
set up with power available. We kick off the evening with a short
inspirational video, and then proceed to interactive discussions with
people showing what they've got. Everyone is welcomed to come and
enjoy, even if you don't have something to exhibit.

We ask folks to register in advance so we have a sense of space
planning. We ask a few basic bits of information:

* Contact info
* Project Description
* How much space you need to show your project
* How much power / networking you need
* Any other special needs
