Every July we gather together in a special HV Open event we call the
Mad Science Fair. People are encouraged to bring their hardware and
software hacking projects in a show and tell forum. We'll have tables
set up with power available. We kick off the evening with a short
inspirational video, and then proceed to interactive discussions with
people showing what they've got. Everyone is welcomed to come and
enjoy, even if you don't have something to exhibit.
