We have so many creative makers in our community, and every year we
dedicate one meeting to create a space to share what they are doing
with others. At the Mad Science Fair, members of our community bring
their projects, hardware, software, feltware, papercraft, musical whatever
medium they work in, and set them up on display for an evening of
show and tell.

## What to Expect ##

Every year is a little different with what shows up. Here is the list
of what's confirmed this year:

* Doing Green Screen Video with Blender - put yourself on the surface
  of Mars!
* Building a Vacuum Tube Headphone Amplifier
* Dive into Ham Radio with a cloud based edge of network device
* Learn to Solder with some easy soldering basics
* A wifi based telescope viewer
* A large addressable LED light installation
* A journey through converting a home to Geothermal Heating & Cooling,
  and collecting data off of the system

Lourdes also has a number of 3D printers, 3D printing pens, and fields
a robotics team, all of which will be on display for the evening. Come
join us for a great night.

## For Attendees ##

Bring your curiosity and your questions and be inspired! Come prepared
to have great conversations with new people that have created some
really fun things.

Please
[RSVP at meetup](https://www.meetup.com/hvopen/events/248938581/) so
we know who's coming.

## For Creators ##

We'd love to host you! But we need to know what you need to be
successful. Please fill
out [this registration form](https://hvopen.org/reg2018) which tells
us how much space and power you need to show off your creation.

**Please Register by July 6th**

Don't worry if your project is only half done. This is about learning
from each other, so the process is also just as interesting as the
destination.
