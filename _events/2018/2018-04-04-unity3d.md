Unity 3D (not to be confused with the Ubuntu's abandoned Unity
project), is a cross-platform game development platform. Using this
platform, you can script your games in JavaScript or C# and drag and
drop objects and components all in a flexible graphical user
interface. In this presentation, Matthias will demonstrate how to
import sprite sheets, attach and write scripts, make animations,
create artwork, game menus, tweak particle systems, use physics, and
more.

### Speaker ###

Matthias Johnson is the Director of Technology at Our Lady of Lourdes
High School, and Program Director for HVOpen. He's been teaching game
programming as part of his role at Lourdes the past few years and is
excited to share some of those experiences.
