**Note: This is an HV Tech event that we are cross promoting**

Let's reconnect! We're going to meet at Hudson Valley's newest
brewery, located in a beautifully renovated old hotel building. There
is plenty of room inside the brewery, and there is a nice patio out
back if the weather permits. Nonalcoholic drinks are available too.

We're keeping this meetup simple - we just want to get together, chat
about what we're up to, and connect with anyone who might be
interested in speaking or volunteering for future Poughkeepsie
meetups. We'll have signup sheets and name tags.

King's Court doesn't have a kitchen, but Cortlandt (the owner) is fine
with bringing outside food or ordering takeout. We'll do a group order
if folks are interested.
