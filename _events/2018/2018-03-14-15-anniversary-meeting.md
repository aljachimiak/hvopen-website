15 years. It's really been 15 years?

Come help us celebrate this with a special anniversary meeting, where our members will give a series of lightning talks about projects that excite them. Thus far, these include:
- Automate the web with python and selenium
- Blender's: Beyond 3D Modeling
- Nine Years of Tech Blogging in Hard Mode
- youtube-dl
- XDP and the Future of Networking

And, it wouldn't be an anniversary without cake! Pat Ladd will again be creating something special for us, as we turn this corner of 15 years in the community. It will be a great evening of sharing and learning.
