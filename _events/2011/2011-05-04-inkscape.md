<img width="128" height="128" align="right" alt="" src="/sites/default/files/128px-Inkscape_logo_2_svg.png" />[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.  Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface.

Sean Swehla by day is your average Linux Technology Center (LTC) employee at IBM, but by night makes sure he earns the name Thor not just because of his viking god resemblance.  Sean has notably been using Inkscape for designs for [squidwrench](http://squidwrench.org/), the community of creative people he helps organize.

### Lightning Talks

Lightning talks are fast 5 - 10 minute presentations that occur at the beginning of the meeting.  They are designed to be a quick show and tell to expose people to something new and interesting in the open source space.  They can be a cool open source project you found, a conference report, or some other piece of news you think people would be interested in.
