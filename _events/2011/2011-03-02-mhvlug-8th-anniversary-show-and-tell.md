To celebrate MHVLUG's 8th Anniversary we're going to do an MHVLUG show and tell.  A number of people will bring recent projects they've been working on, or cool things they've figured out in the open source arena and share those with the group.  Please sign up for a 10 - 15 minute talk on a topic you are interested in.
