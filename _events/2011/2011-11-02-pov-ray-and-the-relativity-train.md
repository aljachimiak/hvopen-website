<img alt="POV-ray" src="/sites/default/files/povray_logo.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;" />[The Persistence of Vision Raytracer](http://www.povray.org/) (POV-Ray, "povray" to its fans) is a multiplatform, ray tracing program. Because it was developed before the GPL by an international team of individuals, some of whom are no longer available, povray is currently "copyrighted freeware", although the development team plans to release a future version under GPL. Povray has been used for creating [stunning three dimensional graphics](http://hof.povray.org/) by showing off different light sources, photon mapping, photo blur and other photorealistic capabilities. Greg will give a brief history of the program and then give an advanced tutorial by explaining, line by line, the code used in one of his more advanced projects. This animation, **The Relativity Train**, is a humorous demonstration about how the speed of light is constant from all points of reference. While GUI modelers are available for povray, this project is all code ... editing text with no GUI. Video and audio recording of the lecture is of course welcome, but the files for the whole project will not be released electronically.

Greg M. Johnson is a failure analysis engineer at IBM's 300 mm semiconductor fab. He has been using povray since 1996 and is the author of some scene files that ship with the program.  As a hobbyist, he has participated in several animation competitions and was the winner (and sole entrant) to the [January 2009 TC-RTC](http://www.tc-rtc.co.uk/competition/animation/2009-January-display25-ratingidtotal.html) competition.  This entry, **[The Relativity Train](http://www.vimeo.com/4205262)**, made use of some of the advanced features of a povray fork called [MegaPov](http://megapov.inetart.net/).
