Since the beginning of time[1] we've used a basic 32bit addressing scheme to get around (known as IP Version 4). The standard four digits, A.B.C.D, are ubiquitous in the technology world, and are the way that computers know how how to find each other.

But all good things must come to an end. Much like the 32bit clock, which runs out in 2037, the 32bit internet is starting to find it's limits. As mobile devices, and rising economies consume the last of the remaing IPv4 addresses, things are about to get interesting.

The technology and standards community have been planning for this for a long time, with a new protocol, IP Version 6. With available IPs dwindling fast, IPv6 will be here before you know it. Are you ready for the changes? Find out what IPv6 is and what the changes mean to you.
