title: DIY 3D Printing and the Makerbot Thing-o-Matic
type: meeting
---


If you can draw a **thing** on a computer display, a 3D printer can (probably) put a plastic **thing** in your hand. Whether you're interested in art objects, prototype products, or repair parts, a 3D printer may be exactly what you need to convert your great ideas into tangible hardware.

For example, you can go from this ...

<img alt="Printed helmet mirror mount" src="/sites/default/files/Helmet%20mirror%20mount%20-%203D%20model%20-%20Fit%20layout.png" height="338" width="333" align="middle" />

... to this ...

<img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/dsc00736%20-%20Mirror%20mount%20-%20glued%20and%20clamped.jpg" height="282" width="375" align="middle" />

... in about an hour. What's not to like?

Ed will discuss what 3D printers can and cannot do, the differences between $10k commercial 3D printers and $1k build-it-yourself 3D printers, what you can expect from contemporary DIY printers, and how to go about creating printable solid models.

The Lords of Cosmic Jest permitting, Ed's Thing-O-Matic printer will produce some parts during the course of the presentation.
