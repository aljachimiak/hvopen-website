Mike Kershaw,Â author of [Kismet](http://www.kismetwireless.net/), gave a great presentation on all things wireless. This included basic user setup under Linux, what cards to look for, how to set up an access point, security issues with wireless, and a demo of Kismet which can map and sniff wireless networks. 60 people came out for this talk, an all time record for MHVLUG!
