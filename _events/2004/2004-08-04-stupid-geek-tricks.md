Several members presented their favorite (or not-so-favorite) Linux trick. Their stories are below.

Alan Snyder / setleds

I presented a little utility program called ***setleds***. In its normal usage, you can use this program to turn on or off the keyboard LEDs on your keyboard for the NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock.

Here is the result of ** 'setleds --help' ** on my current Ubuntu Hoary machine...

Usage:  setleds [-v] [-L] [-D] [-F] -][ num | caps | scroll  Thus,

will set CapsLock, clear NumLock and leave ScrollLock unchanged.

The rest seem to be lost in the anals of history....
