Jim Doherty will be giving an introduction to the X Windows System, the basis for all graphical environments in Linux and Unix operating systems.

The talk will include:
- A history lesson on X11 (how we got here? where we are going? why is it 			   called X anyway?)
- Library Soup
- Security
- Window Managers
- Desktop Environments (KDE &amp; GNOME)
- and a partridge in a pear tree...

We really only have time for an introduction, there are too many components that make up the modern Linux Desktop. You will be left with plenty of pointers to dig in deeper to the different pieces, consider this your road map.
