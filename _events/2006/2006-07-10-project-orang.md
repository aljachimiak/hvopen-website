MHVLUG is proud to announce our July 2006 meeting: MHVLUG Movie Night.<br />
As is tradition in July, we'll be playing a selection of Open Source<br />
related movies.  This year we have a collection of shorts on tap, including<br />
Project Orange (a 3D animation film made entirely in Blender, the Open<br />
Source 3D rendering tool).  We also hope to have a BBC World series on<br />
Open Source in Developing countries (fingers crossed!).
