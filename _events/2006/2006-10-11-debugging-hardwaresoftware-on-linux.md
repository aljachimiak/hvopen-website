type: meeting
---


Joe Apuzzo will present basic debugging tips for Hardware and software problems on Linux.

He will start with a 45 minute run down of the following points:
- Creating a strategy to make Linux your main desktop
- Which Distro do I pick?
- I want to get xyz program to work what can I do?
- I have xyz hardware it does not work what do I do?
- How to maintain Linux over a LONG period of time

Then we will use the remainder of the time for a "hands-on" how to debug issues, by taking questions for the audance. Therefore if you have a burning Linux question/issue we invite you to this fact finding talk!

This is a great talk for all Linux users, from beginner to expert, as tips and tricks will be outlined that even many veterans are not familiar with.
