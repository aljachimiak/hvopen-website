LTSP allows organizations of all sizes and budgets to benefit from the security, scalability, and efficiency of a diskless thin client network.  LTSP is responsible for the deployment of more Linux desktops than any other open source project.  Gideon Romm, CTO of Symbio Technologies ([www.TheSymbiont.com](http://www.TheSymbiont.com)), one of the core LTSP developers - and local White Plains, NY resident - will discuss the benefits of using LTSP and provide insights into the future of the project and the resources available to those interested in taking advantage of all that it has to offer.
