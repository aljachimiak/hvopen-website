This month we'll have something completely different.  Members from MHVLUG will be providing a discussion forum for home networking.  This will include digramming of home networks, some involving complicated scenarios such as VPNs and special routing techniques.  Audience participation is encouraged, and questions about specific scenarios for network setup will be taken from any in attendance.
