This talk covered Linux storage software for making your system safer and more flexible.

RAID helps protect from individual drive failures by spreading data across multiple drives.

LVM is a storage virtualization subsystem that makes it easier to manage your system setup by abstracting the physical storage hardware from the file system. This makes it much easier to resize partitions, add and remove hard drives, along with some more advanced features not available with conventional physical hardware.

The talk featured live demos using VMWare to demonstrate some of the most common scenarios you may encounter.
