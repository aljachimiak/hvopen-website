Come out for a night of show and tell on open hardware projects. Bring your Arduino, Beagle, Raspberry Pi, or other open hardware based project and show it off. Share experiences with others, and learn about all the amazing things you can do with these inexpensive open source platforms.

We'll have tables set up and do this science fair style, where people will roam around and check out projects by others. All levels of experience are welcome to present and participate.

To get you bootstrapped for this event, [Squidwrench](http://squidwrench.org) is going to be making Arduino a theme of their weekly Tuesday meetings.

The night's agenda will go as follows:
- **5:00pm** - setup - anyone that wants to show up early to help setup the room and their project is welcome
- **6:00pm** - Science fair open, go check out everyone's project
- **8:00pm** - retreat to Palace Diner for dinner, dessert, and further geekery
