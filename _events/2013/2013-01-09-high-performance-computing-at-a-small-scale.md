<img src="/sites/default/files/images/IBM_Blue_Gene_P_supercomputer.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;" />High-Performance Computing, or HPC, is the application of "supercomputers" to computation problems that are either too large for standard computers or would take too long. Whether used for simulating protein interaction, modeling weather patterns or rendering the lastest Pixar hit HPC contributes to our daily lives in many ways. Ben will give a background on High Performance Computing, and what it is like to setup an environment at a small college scale.
