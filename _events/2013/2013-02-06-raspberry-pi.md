It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming. 

### The talk will focus on:
- Background: why is there a Raspberry Pi, why should I care?
- From ordering to running desktop/server: Getting, setting-up, and running a Pi, what the average Linux person needs to know .
- Maker Projects: How to exploit your Pi and make it do real world things!
- Digital Lego: Where the Pi is and will be going. Extend your Linux knowledge outside of the box!
- Links: Lots and lots of where to look for help and information.
