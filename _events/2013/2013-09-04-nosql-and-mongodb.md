title: NoSQL and MongoDB
type: meeting
---


This talk will introduce the philosophy and features of the open source, NoSQL MongoDB. We'll quickly dispense with the marketing slides and get into document design, writing a basic application, replication and sharding. And since MHVLUG is so near to his heart, hel'll dive into how to build MongoDB and how he approachs some debugging scenarios.

Mike Grundy was one of the original instigators of MHVLUG, and is now a Member of Technical Staff at 10gen, the MongoDB company. He's previously presented on Open Hardware and The Gimp.
