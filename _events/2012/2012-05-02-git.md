[<img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/images/git-logo.png" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 120px; " />Git](http://git-scm.com/) is one of the leading distributed source code control systems. Originally developed to specifically help with workflows in the Linux kernel, git has seen rapid acceptance on a number of other projects due to it's flexibility and speed. Git takes a bit of education to use effectively, which this talk will hopefully provide.
