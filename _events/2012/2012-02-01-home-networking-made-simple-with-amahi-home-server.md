[<img alt="Amahi logo" src="/sites/default/files/images/amahi_logo.png" style="float: right; " />](http://www.amahi.org/)Amahi is software that runs on a dedicated PC as a central computer for your home. It handles your entertainment, storage, and computing needs. You can store, organize and deliver your recorded TV shows, videos and music to media devices in your network. Share them locally or safely around the world. And it's expandable with a multitude of one-click install apps.

Al Jachimiak is currently the director of bands at the John G. Borden Middle School in Wallkill, NY. In his spare time he has built, rescued, installed, rooted, jailbroken, and hacked innumerable systems. His personal interests lie in paperless solutions for institutions and mixed operating system environments. His foundling venture - Catalyst Custom Technology Consulting - is a jumping off point for future IT opportunities.
