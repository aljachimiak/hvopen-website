title: Open Source DMX Lighting
type: meeting

DMX512 is the standard for controlling lighting and various other stage / theatrical devices. The standard, like all standards, has evolved over time and the physical cabling and implementations can be confusing and proprietary. This meeting will explore how controlled lighting has evolved and some of the open source solutions that are available. There will be a live demonstration programming lights using these open tools so please be mindful of this if you have medical issues that prevent you from being exposed to bright and potentially blinking lights.
