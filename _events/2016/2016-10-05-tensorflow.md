[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library for machine learning. It is currently the most popular open-source ML library on GitHub and a key enabler for developing models for deep learning that power applications in speech translation, image recognition and artificial intelligence.

TensorFlow is a great toolkit for both data scientists (to develop new models) and developers (to power new applications leveraging those models).

In this talk, we will provide a brief introduction to machine learning and TensorFlow, and walk through a simple tutorial that shows TensorFlow in action. I will also share some resources and content for further self-directed exploration.
