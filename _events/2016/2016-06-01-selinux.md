SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions. Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the security policy itself and streamlines the volume of software charged with security policy enforcement.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux)
