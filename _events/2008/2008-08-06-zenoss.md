<img width="217" height="57" align="left" alt="" src="/sites/default/files/Zenoss.gif" />Â Bruce will present on the [Zenoss project](http://www.zenoss.com/). Zenoss is a Enterprise-level Network Management platform whose core is released under the GPLv2 license. The software and the company behind it are upstarts in the Enterprise management field which is dominated by high priced proprietary packages from Fortune 500 companies with short names. The software allows for the monitoring of applications, servers and network devices with an event handling system.

The session will serve as an introduction to the software, its hybrid open/commercial development model, an overview of the internals of Zenoss and how to effectively use the software.
