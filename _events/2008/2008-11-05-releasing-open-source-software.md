There are hundreds of thousands of open source projects out there today, and new ones every day.  Have you ever wondered what it takes to get involved in these projects, or to start your own?

Sean Dague will lead a directed panel discussion with Mike Kershaw, Sean O'Conner, and Mike Mueller on releasing Open Source Software. Topics covered will include basic mechanics and licensing to just get the code out there in the first place, building a community based on that software, and common challenges you may have.

People are encouraged to bring their own questions and experiences to the table, we expect this to be a highly interactive session.
