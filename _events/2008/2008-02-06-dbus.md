DBUS is a relatively new invention in the Linux Desktop. It is a communication bus that Linux applications can use to send events and export functions. Examples of events:
- Network Interface goes up
- Pidgin receives a message
- Screensaver activates

Examples of functions:
- Set pidgin status
- Set rhythbox tracks

The best thing is you can do all of this with very little programming experience, given bindings to DBUS from easy to learn languages like Ruby. The talk will examine some of how DBUS works, give a very brief Ruby crash course, and show some example uses of DBUS with Ruby example code.
