- Changing options on-the-fly with *sysfs*, how to set options during reboot
- Basic kernel configuration
- Building Linux to a .deb package, **as a regular user**
- The initrd.img, what it is, what it does, how to examine it, how to make it
- Basic *git*, *quilt*, and *patch* usage
- Patching the vanilla kernel for AppArmor for use with Ubuntu
- Compiling drivers from the repository to .deb packages (Nvidia, kqemu, etc)

A handout will be included which will give detailed instructions on how to compile and install the Linux kernel for Debian or Ubuntu.
