Blurb: In a lazy tour around his job as Senior Network Analyst for Marist College, Porkchop will cruise the multitude of open source applications and homebrewed applications used day to day maintaining Marist's 5000+ node network. These solutions are not network-engineering-specific, making them a possible source for inspiration for solving your own quandaries.

I'm sorry, but if you missed it, you missed it. There were no prepared slides. This was Porkchops last regular meeting as he has since moved to take a new job in Maryland. He is still on the MHVLUG mailing list.
