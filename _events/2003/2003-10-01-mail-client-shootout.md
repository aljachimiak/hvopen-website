We did a quick shootout demonstrating different mail clients that you can use on Linux.
- Mutt (Sean) - a console email client. Mutt is very light weight, ships with every distribution, and provides many advanced features. It is very good for users that have to deal with a lot of email. The presentation also delved into fetchmail, procmail, and spamassassin. 
- Mozilla Mail (Jim)
- Evolution (Mike)  - a graphical email client. Evolution is a good transition for folks who are used to Outlook, is easy to use and configure, and can talk with Exchange servers. It also provides many advanced features including the weather on the top of Mount Washington. 
- Kmail (Patrick)
