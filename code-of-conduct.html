      HVOpen is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for
      everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression,
      sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body
      size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not
      tolerate harassment of community members in any
      form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
      expelled from the community at the discretion of the HVOpen
      organizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related
      to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation,
      disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race,
      nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation,
      threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or
      recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
      inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
      attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for
      any HVOpen event or communication channel. Community members
      asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the
      anti-harassment policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the HVOpen
      organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
      warning the offender or expulsion from the HVOpen community. If
      you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
      harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a HVOpen
      organizer immediately.
