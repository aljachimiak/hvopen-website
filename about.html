      The Mid Hudson Valley Linux and Open Source Users Group was
      founded in 2003, with our first meeting in March of 2003. While
      the idea for the group had been around since 2002, it took many
      attempts to get a reasonable space to meet.
    </p>
    <p>MHVLUG is an informal organization, that is first and foremost
    about making a constructive, sharing, and welcoming community. If
    you've spent any time in Open Source you'll realize that community
      matters, a lot, and the right community is key to getting anything
    done. MHVLUG has a leadership team which does a lot of the heavy
    lifting, but our tennent is to be open. Our quarterly leadership
    meetings are open to anyone interested. If you are interested in
    helping out, just step forward, and we'll find a way to make it
      happen.
